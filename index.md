I am a BRC-funded postdoctoral researcher with [David Wedge](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/david-wedge) at
the Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford.

I am interested in studying cancer evolution and tumour heterogeneity and in developing novel computational 
approaches to study cancer genomes.
